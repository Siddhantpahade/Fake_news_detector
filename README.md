# Fake_news_detector🕵️
The project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution for automated news credibility detection. The increasing volume of online content has led to a rise in the spread of fake news and spam, which can harm businesses and individuals by promoting fraudulent or low-quality products or services. Spam can harm the reputation of a company or product, reduce productivity, and waste resources. 
Therefore, detecting and removing spam is critical for maintaining a healthy and efficient system. 
This project seeks to streamline and expedite the detection process by leveraging machine learning algorithms.

```

## Execution Steps

=> Just locate your Command Prompt or Powershell to Project Folder

=> Run the following command if want to retrain and get your local model
